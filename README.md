# hello-world

Hellow, everyone!

My name is Sergey. I'm a testing lab technician working for aerospace industry. But, in the future, I would like to change my career becoming, eventually, a full stack software developer with strong engineering science educational background. I know it would not be easy for me to become a software developer, but I will try my best to learn programming. The GitHub, certainly, it the place where I can publish my codes.
